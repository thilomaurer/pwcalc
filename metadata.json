	"description": "This extension calculates strong passwords for each alias from your single secret. No need to remember dozens of passwords any longer. No need for a password manager any longer. Full freedom in choosing aliases and secret, e.g. alias: \"username@google.com#2014\", secret: \"saFe⚿in漢字\". Recent aliases are kept in a easily accessible drop-down. You may choose between HMAC_SHA1 and SHA1. The formula is as simple as \"[secret][alias]\" → SHA1 → BASE64 ",
